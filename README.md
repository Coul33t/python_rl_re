# python_rl_re

Python roguelike, made with the [tdl](https://pythonhosted.org/tdl/) library. [tdl](https://pythonhosted.org/tdl/) is an awesome wrapper around the awesome [libtcod](http://roguecentral.org/doryen/data/libtcod/doc/1.5.1/index2.html) library. This one is similar to my other [python_rl](https://github.com/Coul33t/python_rl), except that this time, the code is actually separated in different modules, AND I mostly use inheritance (and not composition).

By no means I'm saying that the [original tutorial](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod) is bad, but the code is way too interdependant, and use too much global variables (which is, in my opinion, a bad thing).
